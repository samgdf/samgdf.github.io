        Incremental progress is the only sustained progress. You simply can’t change rapidly overnight and expect that to stay. This is due to several things, the most important being that a rapidly changing thing typically belongs to a system which itself does not adequately change to facilitate the change in that thing. Explained another way, if all of a sudden cryptocurrency moons again because of a black swan event, it is unlikely that will be the new baseline price. That will be a new peak, and very quickly a new trough will be made. Over time, there will be gradual progress, unless another black swan event evaporates the total value held in cryptocurrency. That gradual progress, perhaps a result of renewed investor and developer interest in cryptocurrency due to the black swan event, is what stays with cryptocurrency. Peaks and troughs are opportunities for investors who can identify them, but not really reflective of the overall system. This is not to say that the event which created the growth isn’t significant, but a 10x change in price does not necessitate a 10x update in the product, only that there may be 100x the eyes watching. For many things, this reflection point can be where they are dismantled. Either way, you have to face it at one point or another.
      </p><p>
        I bring this up because of how dramatic incremental progress actually is. It is absolutely crazy that we can build on previous growth. The first time some early human swings a bone, and another early human goes “But what if it were sharper?” was a truly transcendent experience. But it is not so simple. Getting to the very simple small changes requires a lot of very deep thinking. While people on their day to day typically take for granted small changes, long-term thinking has to predicate on them. Whenever we value a company, a relationship, or a thought, we value them on their long-term impact. Businesses do not fund raise on what they currently make, but rather what they are projected to make. A relationship, with your children, let’s say, is in no small part because you probably hope that when you are old they will return the favour and take care of you. Or carry on your business.

        This long-term incremental thinking is the only thing (outside of raw talent) I can identify that gives anyone an advantage. No one wins overnight; rather, they win over many nights. Does that make this whole post basically a longwinded motivational gym post? Perhaps, but hopefully just incrementally more useful.
